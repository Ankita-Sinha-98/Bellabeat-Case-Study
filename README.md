The Bellabeat Case Study.pdf document contains all the steps of the Data Analysis process, based on the case study for Bellabeat Welness Company. 
It contains data cleaning, processing, manipulation and analysis using SQL and Google Sheets,

The business task here was to recommend some marketing strategies based on user patterns who use other fitness tracking devices. Here the dataset contains user data for 30 people who use Fitbit as their fitness tracking device. Their daily activity, sleep patterns, weight logs, etc are recorded, some of which are used in our analysis.
